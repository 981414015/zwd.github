                    <p class = "main-text"><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2" target="blank">DOTA2</a> is an esports game which played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. 
                        The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a community-created mod for <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reign_of_Chaos" target="blank">Warcraft III</a>. During every game, each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
                        During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.

                    <p class = "main-text">I started playing Dota since the game was still on Warcraft III when I was 8 years old. Before transitioning to Dota 2 on Steam in 2014, I had been playing the game for around 9 years.
                        According to the record on steam, I have more than 11000 hours on DOTA2 till today. My peak ranking is shown on the left, at rank 240 on the North America Server, which is approximately rank 1000 worldwide.
                        I usually play support role in the game. My favorite hero is Mirana and Enigma(whose ultra ability is Black Hole.) My best heroes are Oracle, Treant, Bane, Silencer and Vengeful Spirit.

                    <p class = "main-text">In Spring 2022, as a member of the Purdue Dota 2 team, I compete in the North American College DOTA2 league. After defeating UCLA, Purdue won the championship. 
                        You can watch the final moments of the grand final game in my personal DOTA2 video bonus part shown above. As shown in the picture on the left, The Exponent, Purdue's newspaper, interviewed our team for winning the championship.
                        In short, I really love this game; I've gained so much intelligence and a better understanding of life by playing it. It helps me grow.

                    <p class = "main-text">In China, people love basketball, and we enjoy playing it both in real life and on PC.
                        NBA 2k is a very popular game worldwide, China has a special version of 2k that allows people to play against each other on PC through Internet called "NBA2KOnline". 
                        Shown in the left video, I like to play the game with tatics and strategies. I reached the highest rank called "Hall of Fame" in this game. 
                        My favorite NBA player is Steve Nash and Kevin Durant.

                    <p class = "main-text">I also love playing other strategy/card games. One is called <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone" target="blank">Hearthstone</a>, which is a famous online card game made by Billiards.
                        The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected hero with a unique power. I have reached the highest rank: "Legend", for 4 reasons using 4 different decks including Paladin, Priest, Rogue and Druid.
                        My favorite hero is Rogue, and I like to build my deck around it because Rogue's cards offer the hardest but highest reward combos to chain together. I have also achieved 12 wins multiple times in the Arena game mode of Hearthstone.

                        I have reached the highest rank: "Queen", for 4 reasons. My favorite style for this game is playing Aqir. 
                        <br></br>
                        Besides these two card/strategy games, I play another survival horror game called <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight" target="blank">Dead by Daylight</a>. I have reached the highest rank of DbD for multiple seasons too.
